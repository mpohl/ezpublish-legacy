Extension eZPersistentObject Inspector for eZ publish
=====================================================

Goals:
======
Produce rich information about the eZPersistenObject subclasses that make up the
core of eZ Publish by parsing the existing online documentation.
The information recovered can then be used for multiple purposes, such as
reinjecting it in the source code as phpdoc comments, or for automated building
of new APIs and ws interfaces.

Besides persisent objects, the extension can currently parse docs for existing
views and fetch functions.


Requirements:
=============
- eZ Publish 4.0 or later
- for accessing online documentation for analysys allow_url_fopen must be on in php.ini


Installation:
=============
- As per standard eZ Publish extensions: drop in extension dir, activate in site.ini override file or via gui
- fix the autoload config: if not activated via the admin interface, run the ezpgenerateautoloads.php script


Then what:
==========
- A script is available that will parse the eZ Publish docs and generate php code
  with the description of all persistent objects, views and fetches.
  NB: pre-built descriptions are already available with the extension, the script
  only needs to be run upon new versions of the docs being released.

- Such description can be recovered in templates using the fetch functions

  fetch('internaldocumentation', 'object', hash('class', string))
  fetch('internaldocumentation', 'fetch', hash('module', string, 'fetch', string))
  fetch('internaldocumentation', 'view', hash('module', string, 'view', string))

  as well as in php code using the methods

  ezPODocScanner::definition( $classname )
  ezFetchDocScanner::definition( $modulename, $fetchname )
  ezViewDocScanner::definition( $modulename, $viewname )
